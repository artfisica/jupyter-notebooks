# jupyter-notebooks
This repository contains all the programming work that is made by myself during the CERN project weeks 2017.
You can find different so called notebooks that are used to explain how data analysis functions in high energy physics.
If you are here for the first time I recommend you to open the "introductional notebooks".
Otherwise you can look after more difficult programs.
